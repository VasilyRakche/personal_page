  #   description: Arriving at the office, collegues have new idea from mechanics problem we were all reasoning about previous days. Makes us quite exited, we brainstorm about all new possibilities, give new suggestion. We reason about new electronic driver, quite more powerful than the one we were speaking before. Now it will be much easier to use the path planner, resources will not be the problem. We go the blackboard, everybody wants to try out so many new ideas. One proposes simple stabilisation solution that should work great with new mechanics. I hurry to a computer to manage tasks for the team, before we start to work on algorithm code. In 2h I will need to go to other department to see how we can start merging latest solutions ...
